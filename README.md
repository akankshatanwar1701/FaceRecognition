# Face Detection and Recognition
Face Recognition using OpenCV, KNN-Algorithm and OOP concepts

## **INTRODUCTION**-
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.

## **LIBRARIES USED**-
**OpenCV**- OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
**NumPy**- NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these array.
**OS**- OS  module in python is a way of using operating system based functionality. The function that OS module provides allows you to interface with the underlying operating system that python is running on â€“ be the Windows, Mac or Linux. You can find important information about your location or about the process. 

## Classifier Used-
Haar Cascade Classifier

This project uses the face detection code to create a database consisting of faces of detected people in the form of .npy files in a folder namely **data.**
Faces of multiple people can be detected in a continuous manner i.e the program will take in data till the collector wants to provide it with the same **(_OOP_)**.
The Recognition Program works on KNN Algorithm to identify the person in front of the camera by using the database created in the **data** folder.
